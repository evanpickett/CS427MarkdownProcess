| Jabref [Empty entry in JabRef leads to Error when compiling in LaTeX](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8096) | This is important because users could run into this issue fairly commonly. Adding the feature of the confirmation dialog helps remind users of any empty entries they may have added accidentally and forgotten to delete. This avoids potential errors users may run into when compiling in LaTex if their JabRef library has empty entries. | Anna Qian (ruoyuq2) | Wrote test scenario (Test ID: confirmEmptyEntries) <p>Please see the first entry in Table Test Scenario  for details.</p> | Yes, I used both Spotbugs and PMD to check my code. <p>Please see the first entry in Table Code Bug-Free for details.</p> | Yes, added Javadoc comment for the added public method: hasEmptyEntries() in BibDatabaseContext.java | Yes, created [unit tests](http://src/test/java/org/jabref/gui/fieldeditors/LinkedFileViewModelTest.java) for the added public method: hasEmptyEntries(). <p>Since this is a GUI feature, I did use case tests as well. Please see the column ‘Results After Fixing the Issue’ of the first entry in Table Test Scenario for details. | [PR](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8218) merged<p></p><p>Week 10/25- 10/31:</p><p>Comfiled Jabref using IntelliJ internal build. Reproduced the error and wrote a test scenario for the error.</p><p></p><p>Week 11/1- 11/7:</p><p>Understood the code structure of Jabref and implemented my solution.</p><p></p><p>Week 11/8- 11/14:</p><p>Submitted PR and worked with the developers to improve my solution. Eventually, my PR was merged.</p> |
|Jabref <p>[The directory pattern is not considered when checking if a file can be moved](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7908) </p>|Fixing this bug is important to enhance good user experience. Right now, if users have set the default directory pattern for linked files, they cannot move linked files in the way it is supposed to work. |Anna Qian <p>(ruoyuq2) </p>|Wrote test scenario (Test ID: considerDirectoryPatternWhenMovingFiles) <p>Please see the second entry in **Table Test Scenario**  for details. </p>|Yes, I used both Spotbugs and PMD to check my code.  <p>Please see the second entry in **Table Code Bug-Free** for details. </p>|Yes, <p>added Javadoc comment for the added public method: </p><p>equals() in FileHelper.java </p>|Not yet, but will work on this next week. <p>But I have done use case tests since this is a GUI feature.

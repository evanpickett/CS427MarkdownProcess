However, the developers wanted me to double check the ACRA source code to understand how my method compares to the method they are using.  After analysis, ACRA is calling the same Android OS function (StatFs) to retrieve the storage information that I was utilizing.  Based on this assessment the issue may be able to be closed out, without a PR. |sethlb2 |N/A (no new public method) |2 weeks (1 week to familiarize myself with ACRA (Application Crash Report for Android)  and 1 week to develop a solution including discussion with core developers and deep dive into ACRA to understand how the library is querying storage space within the Android OS) |+52 <p>-19 </p>|
